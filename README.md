# Python-Logistic-Regression-Titanic-Survivorship

** ***THIS REPOSITORY IS UNDER CONTRUCTION*** **


**SUMMARY**

This project performs binary logistic regression modeling to classify a passenger's survivorship as died or survived. It focuses more on statistics to select features, understand assumptions and evaluate results, rather than simply iteratively transforming and selecting features to achieve a best performing model, as was the case in the **[Boston House Prices](https://github.com/aaronmkwong/Python-Linear-Regression-Boston-House-Prices)** project. The Titanic Survivorship project too is intended to be limited in scope as a learning sprint with its code and methods potentially applied to more robust model versions in the future.             

Of the given features, imputation, parsing, dummy encoding and scaling are used to obtain 13 engineered features. Model assumptions reviewed include: the dependent variable is binary; observations are independent; the independent variables are not multicollinear; the independent variables and log odds are linear; the dataset is large. The results were evaluated using a Pearson Residual to identify outliers, which may be indicative of remaining issues with feature engineering or regression assumptions.   

The Titanic dataset is available through the **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)** competition web page.
